    <h1>Unconditional Love</h1>
    <h2>Tupac Shakur</h2>
    <h5>
        What y'all want? Unconditional love (no doubt)
       Talkin' about the stuff that don't wear off, it don't fade (unconditional love)
       It'll last for all these crazy days, these crazy nights
       Whether you wrong or you right
       A m- f- still love you, still feel you
       Still there for you, no matter what, he-he (unconditional love, oh-oh)
       You will always be in my heart with unconditional love (oh-ooh)
       Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
       All my peers doin' years beyond drug dealin'
       How many caskets can we witness (oh-ooh)
       Before we see it's hard to live this life without God?
       So we must ask forgiveness
       Ask mama why I got this urge to die
       Witness the tears fallin' free from my eyes before she could reply
       Though we were born without a silver spoon
    </h5>
